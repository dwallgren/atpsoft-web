Our name is also inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate">ATP molecule</a>.<br />

We are a small development shop started by two brothers that were tired of dealing with software that was good but incomplete. Our goal in everything we do is to make software that is both usable and extremely functional. We started with a task management software (Jade tasks) that we are working towards making the most usable and functional task management software ever. Give us time and we will change the way you task!

No Test [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
